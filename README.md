## Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered multi-agent system designed to research, analyze, and report on the procurement of Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery packs within the Egyptian market. Leveraging the CrewAI framework and large language models (LLMs), it automates data gathering, market analysis, regulatory compliance, and report generation.

The final output includes structured JSON data and a professionally formatted LaTeX report, ready for publication and presentation.

## Features
- Procurement Research Agent: Gathers supplier data, pricing, stock levels, technical specs, and more.
- Market Analyst Agent: Analyzes market size, trends, competition, risks, and opportunities.
- Regulatory Compliance Agent: Reviews local and international compliance requirements and standards.
- Report Enhancer Agent: Compiles all findings into a comprehensive LaTeX report ready for Overleaf.
- Sequential task execution: Ensures organized workflow with clear dependencies.
- Environment variable management: Secure API key handling using .env.
- Extensible architecture: Easily add or modify agents and tasks.
- Output: JSON structured outputs and a final LaTeX report.
