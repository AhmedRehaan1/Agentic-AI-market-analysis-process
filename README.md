# Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Battery Procurement & Market Analysis in Egypt




## Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered multi-agent system designed to research, analyze, and report on the procurement of Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery packs within the Egyptian market. Leveraging the CrewAI framework and large language models (LLMs), it automates data gathering, market analysis, regulatory compliance, and report generation.

The final output includes structured JSON data and a professionally formatted LaTeX report, ready for publication and presentation.
